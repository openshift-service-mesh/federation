# Federation

A Kubernetes controller that provides discovery service for Istio mesh federation.

Mesh federation allows exposing services between meshes and enabling communication across mesh boundaries.
Each mesh may expose a subset of its services to allow other meshes to connect to the exposed services.

Controllers utilize XDS protocol to discover exported services in federated meshes.
Controllers are deployed with sidecars, so cross-cluster connections between controllers are secured with Istio mTLS.

## Motivation

In this deployment model, independent meshes deployed in different clusters can connect services without configuring
access to the k8s api-server in remote clusters. This allows to achieve multi-cluster connectivity for meshes managed
by different teams in different clusters.

## Development

### Prerequisites
1. Go 1.22+
2. protoc 3.19.0+
3. protoc-gen-go v1.30.0+
4. protoc-get-golang-deepcopy

### Commands

1. Compile controller:
    ```shell
    make
    ```
1. Run unit tests:
    ```shell
    make test
    ```
1. Build image:
    ```shell
    HUB=quay.io/maistra-dev TAG=test make docker-build
    ```
1. Push image:
    ```shell
    HUB=quay.io/maistra-dev TAG=test make docker-push
    ```
1. Run e2e tests:
    ```shell
    make e2e
    ```
1. Run e2e tests with specific Istio version and custom controller image:
    ```shell
    HUB=quay.io/maistra-dev TAG=test ISTIO_VERSION=1.23.0 make e2e
    ```
1. Run specific test suites:
    ```shell
    TEST_SUITES="spire" make e2e
    ```
1. Customize federation controller image used in tests (`TAG` is ignored if `USE_LOCAL_IMAGE=true` or not set):
   ```shell
   USE_LOCAL_IMAGE=false HUB=quay.io/maistra-dev TAG=0.1 make e2e
   ```
