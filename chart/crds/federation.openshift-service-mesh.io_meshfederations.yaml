                      Currently, only two types are supported: istio and openshift-router.
                      If "istio" is set, then the controller assumes that the Service associated with federation ingress gateway
                      is LoadBalancer or NodePort and is directly accessible for remote peers, and then it only creates
                      an auto-passthrough Gateway to expose exported Services.
                      When "openshift-router" is enabled, then the controller creates also OpenShift Routes and applies EnvoyFilters
                      to customize the SNI filter in the auto-passthrough Gateway, because the default SNI DNAT format used by Istio
                      is not supported by OpenShift Router.
